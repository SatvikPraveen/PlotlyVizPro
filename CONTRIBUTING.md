## 🎯 What You Can Work On

✅ Add new visualization notebooks

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

* Prefer using `pytest` for testing utility functions.
* Use `assert` statements inside notebooks for sanity checks.
* Validate exported plots (HTML, PNG) are correctly generated and saved in `/exports`.

---

## 💡 Style Guide

* Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for code formatting.
* Use meaningful variable and function names.
* Write docstrings for all functions in `utils/`.
* Avoid hardcoding paths—use `Pathlib` when possible.
